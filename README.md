# AVL
This is an implementation of AVL tree.
You can revise the transition probability in main function to test its functionality.
The following operations are implemented.

* insert a element
* delete a element
* query the rank of a given element .
* query the element by a given rank. (When is does not exist, decrease the rank until it exists.)
* query the size

(Note: The 'rank' of an element is defined as the number of elements which are smaller than it.)
